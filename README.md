Project: Project and Task Management System

This repository is a Project and Task Management System designed to help users manage projects and their associated tasks efficiently. It features a backend API implemented in Spring Boot and a frontend built with React.js.

Features Project Management:

Create, view, update, and delete projects. Automatically delete all associated tasks when a project is deleted. Task Management:

Create tasks associated with a specific project. Update task descriptions and statuses (pending/completed). Delete individual tasks. Database Integration:

Uses a relational database (e.g., Oracle) for persistent storage. Automatic cascading deletes for tasks when a project is removed. User Interface:

A responsive and interactive web interface for managing projects and tasks. Inline form validation and error handling.

Prerequisites Java (JDK 11 or later) Maven (Build Tool) Node.js and npm Oracle Database or any compatible RDBMS Git (for cloning the repository)

Steps to Run the Project

Clone the Repository Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/rahul420206/Project-and-Task-Management-System.git

cd project-task-management

Set Up the Database Open your database tool (e.g., SQL Developer, DBeaver, or any SQL client). Create a new database schema. Paste and execute the following SQL script to create the required tables:
-- Create Project table CREATE TABLE Project ( id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL, created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );

-- Create Todo table CREATE TABLE Todo ( id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, project_id NUMBER NOT NULL, description VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL, status NUMBER(1) DEFAULT 0 CHECK (status IN (0, 1)), -- 0 for pending, 1 for complete created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, updated_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CONSTRAINT fk_project FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES Project(id) ON DELETE CASCADE );

-- Optional: Create an index on project_id in the Todo table CREATE INDEX idx_project_id ON Todo (project_id);

Configure Backend Navigate to the backend project folder
cd hello

Update the application.properties file (located in src/main/resources) with your database credentials:

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe spring.datasource.username=your_username spring.datasource.password=your_password spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update spring.jpa.show-sql=true

Replace the "PASTE_YOUR_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE" with you actual Github Access Token

Run the backend server using Maven: mvn spring-boot-run

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080

Configure Frontend Navigate to the frontend folder: cd ../frontend
Install dependencies: npm install

Run the frontend server: npm start

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000

How the Application Works Create a Project:

Enter a project title to create a new project. The project is stored in the Project table. Add Tasks:

Select a project and add tasks associated with it. Each task is stored in the Todo table, linked to the corresponding project.

Update Task Status:

Mark tasks as pending (0) or complete (1). Error Handling:

The application handles invalid actions gracefully, showing appropriate error messages.

Technologies Used

Backend: Spring Boot (REST API) Hibernate (ORM) Oracle Database Frontend: React.js (UI) Axios (HTTP Client)

Known Issues: A project can be deleted only when all the tasks associated with it are deleted. This is because the cascading delete behavior is not set in the database. If you need it you can alter the table to turn ON DELETE CASCADE constraint.
